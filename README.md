Developing an app is no joke, it is a responsibility. A responsibility to deliver a full project and complete all the necessary tasks and deal with potential errors. Developing an app requires dedication and focus. Most importantly you must know how to approach an app. If the app is for business, it shouldn’t have playful or goofy elements. It must be prim and proper otherwise you will not please your clients. I have chosen a professional look for my application as this app is used for educational purposes. It has a minimal UI.  This app inputs a user’s name and matches with the age of death of a historic figure. The app also does tell you about the person who has been output. This was all done through general knowledge, and I had no online research done.
42 -> "Elvis Presley who was a famous, influential and controversial singer."
50 -> "Michael Jackson who was referred to as the king of pop and the greatest artist     of all time."
52 -> "William Shakespeare who was a famous and talented writer."
53 -> "George Michael who was a talented singer."
56 -> "Abraham Lincoln who was a lawyer, politician and statesman who served as the 16th president of USA."
66 -> "Kevin Conroy who was an iconic voice actor of Batman."
67 -> "George Washington who was the first president of USA."
76 -> "Aretha Franklin who was referred as the greatest female singer of all time."
 85 -> "Benjamin Franklin who was a famous inventor and philanthropist."
 95 -> "Nelson Mandela who was a politician that helped the struggle to end apartheid."
I chose figures I had a personal relation to such as Kevin Conroy through his voice acting and Elvis Presley through his music and figures I grew up learning about such as Nelson Mandela and George Washington. These are serious figures in history therefore the need to have a serious GUI.  I would not dare associate these figures with something childish.  

I put the photos in the UI which gives into the historic aesthetic.  I was late registration so I got a tutor from VC to help me get up too speed, he did a good job as I coded this project with only a little help using ethical AI help in chatgpt to fix a line that wasn’t working.  I made use of various elements in the palette. In my app if you make a mistake or want to clear the output data you can easily by pressing the clear button. I hope that you enjoy using my app.
